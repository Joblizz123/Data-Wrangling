1. The rating column numerator should be a float datatype
2. Timestamp and retweeted_status_timestamp datatypes should be datetime instead of object.
3. There are about 181 retweets in the retweeted_status_id column
4. Incorrect ratings of 75/10 and 5/10
5. The jpg_urls column in image_pred_copy contains duplicates
6. The name column contains 'None', an indication of incorrect imputations
7. The datatype of tweet_id for the three datasets is int
8. Unwanted columns in the df1 dataset For the tidiness issues:For the tidiness issues: For the tidiness issues: For the tidiness issues: For the tidiness issues: For the tidiness issues: i. The dog stages should be on one column ii. The three datasets should be one dataframe 3. CLEANING THE DATA: The quality and tidiness issues outlined above were addressed as the datasets were cleaned using the define-code-test method 4. STORING THE CLEANING: The cleaned dataframe was therefore, ready for analysis and vsiualizaton.
